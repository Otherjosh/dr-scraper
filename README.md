# dr-scraper
This project was to scrape doctor information from healthgrades, for a set of excel sheets provided by the client that had doctor names in them.
Originally this was saving the data after each search in the excel sheet, eventually I changed it to save after each new doctor as there were many rows of data for each doctor in the excel sheets provided which greatly increased the speed at which the data was being collected.
